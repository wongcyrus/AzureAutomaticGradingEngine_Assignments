# NPC Character Background System

## 🎭 **Purpose: Unique NPC Personalities and Tones**

### **Problem Solved**
- All NPCs had the same generic responses
- No personality differentiation between characters
- Monotonous learning experience

### **Solution Implemented**
- New `NPCCharacter` table stores character backgrounds
- Each NPC has unique: Name, Age, Gender, Background
- Enables personalized communication styles and tones

## 📊 **Database Schema**

### **NPCCharacter Table**
```sql
NPCCharacter {
  PartitionKey: "NPC"           -- Fixed partition for all NPCs
  RowKey: string                -- NPC Name (e.g., "TrainerA")
  Name: string                  -- Display name
  Age: int                      -- Character age
  Gender: string                -- Character gender
  Background: string            -- Detailed character background and personality
  Timestamp: DateTimeOffset     -- Azure Table timestamp
  ETag: ETag                    -- Azure Table ETag
}
```

2. **Grading Feedback**: Responses can match NPC personality
3. **Variety Messages**: Cross-NPC interactions can reflect character traits
4. **Error Messages**: Even error responses can be personalized

### **Example Personality-Based Responses**

#### **TrainerA (Professional)**
- Task Assignment: "I have prepared a comprehensive networking challenge for you. Please ensure you follow the security best practices outlined in the requirements."
- Success: "Excellent work! Your implementation demonstrates a solid understanding of Azure networking principles."

## 🔄 **Implementation Flow**

### **Current State**
1. Student talks to NPC → Generic response
2. All NPCs sound the same
3. No personality differentiation

### **Enhanced State**
1. Student talks to NPC → System retrieves NPC character data
2. Response generated based on character background
3. Each NPC has unique voice and personality
4. More engaging and varied learning experience

## 🛠 **Technical Implementation**

### **Storage Service Integration**
```csharp
// Get NPC character data
var npcCharacter = await _storageService.GetNPCCharacterAsync(npcName);

// Use background to customize responses
if (npcCharacter != null)
{
    // Generate personality-appropriate response
    var response = GeneratePersonalizedResponse(message, npcCharacter.Background);
}
```

### **Response Customization**
- **Age**: Influences language formality and references
- **Gender**: Affects pronoun usage and communication style
- **Background**: Determines expertise areas and communication tone
- **Specialization**: Influences which tasks they prefer to assign

## 🎓 **Educational Benefits**

### **Enhanced Engagement**
- **Variety**: Each NPC feels like a different person
- **Immersion**: More realistic character interactions
- **Motivation**: Students enjoy diverse personalities
- **Relatability**: Different students connect with different NPCs

### **Learning Diversity**

- **Specialization**: NPCs can focus on their expertise areas
- **Real-World Simulation**: Mimics working with different team members
- **Communication Skills**: Students adapt to different communication styles

## 🧪 **Testing Commands**

```javascript
// Test NPC character retrieval
async function testNPCCharacter(npcName) {
  const response = await fetch(`/api/npc-character?npc=${npcName}`);
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log(`${npcName} Character:`, data);
}

// Test all sample NPCs
async function testAllNPCs() {
  const npcs = ['TrainerA', 'TrainerB', 'TrainerC', 'MentorAlex', 'GuideZara'];
  for (const npc of npcs) {
    await testNPCCharacter(npc);
  }
}

// Seed sample data
async function seedNPCs() {
  const response = await fetch('/api/npc-character?action=seed');
  const data = await response.json();
  console.log('Seed Result:', data);
}
```
